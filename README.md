three different visualizations of the dataset

For the first visualization, I tried to offer visualization of information to answer question "Which antibiotic is effective for certain bacterias." I used heat-map to show information by color, but there are major flaws in this diagram due to large domain. Because of the large domain, the colors that are shown on the actual diagram are not shown on the colorscale. The lighter the color is, the less the antibiotic is needed. By looking at the colors, the viewers can identify which antibiotic is more useful in the specified bacteria, which is shown on the left hand side.

For the second visualization, I tried to offer visualization of information to answer question "Is there any correlation between amount of Penicilin needed with Streptomycin needed?" I used scatter plot. I put Penincilin(MIC) on the x-axis and Streptomycin on the y-axis to show whether there are any correlation on their xy relationship. However, because there are no visible trends on the scatterplot, the viewers can tell that there are no correlation between the two antibiotics.

For the third visualization, I tried to answer quesiton "Is there big difference between amount of antibiotic needed for negative Gram Staining and positive Gram Staining?" by using box plots. My intention was to have same antibiotics's positive result and negative result to be next to each other, but I could not figure it out. However, by using the box plot, the viewers are able to see how much differences there are by comparing the size of the boxes.
